Abstract

Two of the most important results of recent technological advancements are process automation
and making knowledge more accessible. Based on that, I have created a system that has as the main
aim to behave like a football goalkeeping coach. Given a football game video sequence, it is able
to show what is the optimal position for the goalkeeper, helping him to understand how to position
himself on the pitch.
To achieve this, the given video has to be processed by detecting the color green(the predominant
color of the field), segmentation the image by separating the color white which belongs to the fieldâ€™s
line and after having this, it detects the bottom line. The system uses Yolo v4 combined with a deep
sort algorithm for tracking the players from the field and the ball. From these are selected the player
who is the closest from the ball and the goalkeeper which is found by being the closest by the bottom
line. A velocity vector is drawn for the player who has the ball and for the goalkeeper and the result
will suggest the correct position of the keeper.
This work is the outcome of my own efforts. On this project, I have neither offered nor received
unlawful help.
